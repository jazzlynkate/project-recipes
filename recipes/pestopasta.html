    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Not all green dishes are created equal, and this pasta recipe is definitely overflowing with flavours. Pesto pasta is an Italian dish made with noodles tossed in a sauce made with crushed garlic, pine nuts, salt, basil leaves, Parmigiano-Reggiano or Pecorino Sardo and olive oil.</p>
    <p>Any pasta can be used on this dish, I had tried it on penne, ziti, fettucine but I am a simple guy, so a thin spaghetti is my usual preference. As for the serving, you can serve it on its own, with meat or with seafood, either way with pesto on your table you are in for a really nice meal.</p>
